Delivery 3: Text Classification using Deep Learning Models
==================
In the third delivery of the term project, we will be working on text classification using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. The implemented models include FastText, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and a Transformer-based Model.

How to execute the scripts?
------------------
Please checkout the Jupyter Notebooks for a detailed understanding of this delivery.

Directory Structure
------------------
Please place the `dataset.json` from the second delivery inside data directory.
